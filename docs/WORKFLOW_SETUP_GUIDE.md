# üöÄ GitHub Actions Workflow Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the enterprise-grade CI/CD workflows that were designed for this repository. Due to GitHub security restrictions, workflow files must be manually copied from the templates provided.

## üîí Security Note

GitHub prevents automated creation of workflow files for security reasons. This is a **good security practice** that we respect. The workflows are provided as templates that you can review and implement manually.

## üìã Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Copy Workflow Files

Copy the following files from `docs/workflows-templates/` to `.github/workflows/`:

```bash
# Create workflows directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .github/workflows/

# Copy the workflow templates
cp docs/workflows-templates/ci.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/workflows-templates/security.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/workflows-templates/release.yml .github/workflows/
```

### Step 2: Configure Secrets

Add the following secrets in your GitHub repository settings (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`):

#### Required Secrets
- `PYPI_API_TOKEN` - For publishing packages to PyPI
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub

#### Optional Secrets (for enhanced functionality)
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` - For code coverage reporting
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` - For team notifications
- `GITLEAKS_LICENSE` - For enhanced secret scanning

### Step 3: Enable Workflow Permissions

Go to `Settings > Actions > General` and ensure:
- ‚úÖ **Allow all actions and reusable workflows**
- ‚úÖ **Read and write permissions** for GITHUB_TOKEN
- ‚úÖ **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests**

## üèóÔ∏è Workflow Architecture

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
**Enterprise-grade continuous integration with 7 specialized jobs:**

- **Code Quality & Security**: Pre-commit hooks, linting, security scanning
- **Multi-Platform Testing**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS with Python 3.9-3.12
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Automated regression detection
- **Container Builds**: Multi-architecture Docker images
- **Documentation**: Auto-deployment to GitHub Pages
- **Release Integration**: Seamless handoff to release pipeline
- **Notifications**: Team alerts and PR comments

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`
- Manual workflow dispatch

### 2. Security Framework (`security.yml`)
**Comprehensive security scanning and compliance:**

- **Static Analysis**: CodeQL + Semgrep with SARIF integration
- **Dependency Scanning**: Safety + pip-audit with vulnerability reports
- **Container Security**: Trivy + Grype vulnerability scanning
- **Secret Detection**: GitLeaks + TruffleHog with baseline management
- **License Compliance**: Automated license checking and reporting
- **SLSA Provenance**: Software supply chain security

**Triggers:**
- Push to main branches
- Pull requests
- Daily security scans at 3 AM UTC
- Manual security audits

### 3. Release Automation (`release.yml`)
**Full release lifecycle management:**

- **Version Management**: Automated semantic versioning
- **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Staging and production
- **Package Publishing**: PyPI + container registry
- **Documentation Updates**: Automated changelog and documentation
- **Health Checks**: Post-deployment validation
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Automated failure recovery

**Triggers:**
- Manual release workflow dispatch
- Git tags matching `v*` pattern

## üéØ Advanced Configuration

### Environment-Specific Settings

#### Staging Environment
```yaml
environment:
  name: staging
  url: https://staging.your-domain.com
```

#### Production Environment
```yaml
environment:
  name: production
  url: https://your-domain.com
```

### Custom Runners (Optional)

For enhanced performance, configure self-hosted runners:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]
```

### Monitoring Integration

Configure monitoring services in workflow environment variables:

```yaml
env:
  DATADOG_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.DATADOG_API_KEY }}
  NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY }}
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Workflow Permission Errors
**Solution**: Check repository settings for Actions permissions

#### 2. Secret Not Found Errors
**Solution**: Verify all required secrets are configured

#### 3. Docker Build Failures
**Solution**: Ensure Docker service is available and properly configured

#### 4. Test Failures
**Solution**: Run tests locally first: `make test`

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting repository variable:
```
ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG = true
```

## üìä Monitoring & Metrics

### Built-in Dashboards

The workflows provide:
- **Build Status**: Real-time build and deployment status
- **Security Posture**: Vulnerability scanning results
- **Performance Metrics**: Test execution times and benchmark results
- **Code Quality**: Coverage reports and quality metrics

### Integration Points

- **GitHub Pages**: Automated documentation deployment
- **Container Registry**: Multi-architecture image publishing  
- **PyPI**: Automated package publishing
- **Security Dashboard**: Vulnerability and compliance reporting

## üéâ Validation

After setup, validate the workflows:

1. **Create a test PR** to trigger CI pipeline
2. **Check Actions tab** for workflow execution
3. **Verify security scans** complete successfully
4. **Test release process** with a patch version bump

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the [GitHub Actions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
2. Review workflow logs in the Actions tab
3. Consult the troubleshooting section above
4. Open an issue with detailed error information

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once workflows are active:
1. **Team Training**: Brief team on new CI/CD processes
2. **Environment Setup**: Configure staging and production environments
3. **Monitoring**: Set up alerting and notification channels
4. **Documentation**: Update team processes and runbooks

---

**These workflows transform your repository into an enterprise-grade platform with:**
- ‚úÖ Automated quality gates and security scanning
- ‚úÖ Zero-downtime deployment capabilities
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive compliance and audit trails
- ‚úÖ Production-ready operational excellence
