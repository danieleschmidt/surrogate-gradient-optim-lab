# 🚀 Operational Excellence Guide

## Overview

This guide outlines the operational excellence practices implemented for the Surrogate Gradient Optimization Lab, designed for enterprise-grade deployment and maintenance.

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Distributed Tracing

The project includes comprehensive OpenTelemetry tracing:

```python
from surrogate_optim.observability import trace_training, create_span

@trace_training("optimization_workflow")
def run_optimization(data, config):
    with create_span("data_preprocessing", {"dataset_size": len(data)}):
        # Preprocessing logic
        pass
    
    with create_span("model_training", config):
        # Training logic with automatic performance tracking
        pass
```

### Prometheus Metrics

Production-ready metrics collection:

```python
from surrogate_optim.observability import track_training_time, set_training_loss

# Automatic timing and metrics collection
with track_training_time("neural_network"):
    loss = train_model()
    set_training_loss(loss, "neural_network", "mse")
```

### Key Metrics Collected
