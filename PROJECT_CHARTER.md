# PROJECT CHARTER: Surrogate Gradient Optimization Lab

## Executive Summary

**Project Name**: Surrogate Gradient Optimization Lab  
**Project Code**: SGOL  
**Start Date**: 2024  
**Project Lead**: Daniel Schmidt, Terragon Labs  
**Status**: Active Development  

## Problem Statement

Many real-world optimization problems involve expensive black-box functions where gradients are unavailable:
- Expensive simulations (fluid dynamics, finite element analysis)
- Hardware optimization requiring physical testing
- Human feedback optimization
- Neural architecture search with costly training

Traditional gradient-free methods are sample-inefficient, while gradient-based methods require differentiability.

## Solution Overview

The Surrogate Gradient Optimization Lab provides a toolkit that:
1. **Learns differentiable surrogates** from offline black-box function evaluations
2. **Enables gradient-based optimization** on the learned surrogates
3. **Combines multiple surrogate types** (neural networks, Gaussian processes, random forests)
4. **Provides uncertainty quantification** for reliable optimization
5. **Offers comprehensive benchmarking** against standard optimization problems
