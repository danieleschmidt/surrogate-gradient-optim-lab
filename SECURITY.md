We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to us directly:

- **Email**: security@terragon-labs.com
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] Surrogate Gradient Optimization Lab Vulnerability Report

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: What could an attacker achieve by exploiting this vulnerability?
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal proof of concept
5. **Environment**: Operating system, Python version, package version
6. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas on how to fix the issue

### Example Report Template

```
Subject: [SECURITY] Buffer overflow in surrogate model training

Description:
A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the neural network surrogate 
model training function when processing malformed input data.

Impact:
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by providing specially 
crafted training data that causes a buffer overflow.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Create a training dataset with extremely large feature values
2. Attempt to train a neural network surrogate model
3. Observe that the application crashes with a segmentation fault

Environment:
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04
- Python: 3.9.7
- Package Version: 0.1.0
- JAX Version: 0.4.1

Proof of Concept:
[Include minimal code example that demonstrates the vulnerability]

Suggested Fix:
Add input validation to check feature value ranges before training.
```

## Security Best Practices

When using this package, please follow these security best practices:

### Input Validation

- Always validate input data before passing to surrogate models
- Use appropriate bounds checking for optimization parameters
- Sanitize file paths when loading/saving models

### Model Security

- Be cautious when loading pre-trained models from untrusted sources
- Validate model architectures before training
- Use appropriate random seeds for reproducible but secure training

### Data Privacy

- Be mindful of sensitive data in training datasets
- Consider differential privacy techniques for sensitive applications
- Ensure proper data sanitization before model training

### Dependency Management

- Keep dependencies up to date with latest security patches
- Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Use virtual environments to isolate package dependencies

### Environment Security

- Use appropriate access controls for model files and data
- Monitor system resources during training to prevent DoS
- Use container security best practices when deploying

## Known Security Considerations

### JAX and GPU Computation

- JAX JIT compilation may expose timing information
- GPU memory management could leak sensitive data
- Consider using CPU-only mode for sensitive applications

### Model Training

- Large models may consume excessive system resources
- Untrusted training data could influence model behavior
- Model checkpoints may contain sensitive information

### Optimization Algorithms

- Some optimization algorithms may be susceptible to adversarial inputs
- Trust region methods provide some protection against malicious objectives
- Consider input sanitization for black-box functions

## Security Scanning

This project uses automated security scanning:

- **Bandit**: Static security analysis for Python code
