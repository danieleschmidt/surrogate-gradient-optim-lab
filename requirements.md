# Project Requirements

## Problem Statement

Surrogate Gradient Optimization Lab (surrogate-gradient-optim-lab) is a toolkit for offline black-box optimization using learned gradient surrogates. The project enables gradient-based optimization for scenarios where traditional gradients are unavailable, such as simulators, hardware interfaces, or human feedback systems.

## Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - Provide multiple surrogate model types (Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes, Random Forests)
   - Support offline optimization with pre-collected data
   - Enable gradient-based optimization using learned surrogates
   - Offer visual diagnostics and interactive dashboards
   - Include comprehensive benchmark suite for validation

2. **Performance Requirements**
   - Support optimization in 2D to 50D spaces
   - Achieve <5% optimality gap on standard test functions
   - Process 1000+ data points in <10 seconds
   - Enable GPU acceleration for large-scale problems

3. **Quality Requirements**
   - 90%+ test coverage across all modules
   - Sub-second API response times
   - Memory usage <2GB for typical problems
   - Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
