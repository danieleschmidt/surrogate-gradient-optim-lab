- Alerting rules and runbooks

### CHECKPOINT 6: Workflow Documentation & Templates

**Required Files to Create:**
```
docs/workflows/
├── README.md
├── ci-cd-overview.md
└── examples/
    ├── ci.yml              # Main CI workflow
    ├── cd.yml              # Deployment workflow
    ├── security-scan.yml   # Security scanning
    ├── dependency-update.yml
    ├── release.yml         # Release automation
    └── docs-deploy.yml     # Documentation deployment

├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/
│   ├── bug_report.yml
│   ├── feature_request.yml
│   └── config.yml
├── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
└── CODEOWNERS
```

**Manual Action Required:**
After creating the workflow documentation, manually create GitHub Actions workflows by copying the templates from `docs/workflows/examples/` to `.github/workflows/`.

### CHECKPOINT 7: Metrics & Automation Setup

**Required Files to Create:**
```
.github/project-metrics.json    # Repository metrics config
scripts/
├── metrics-collector.py        # Automated metrics collection
├── health-check.py            # Repository health monitoring
├── dependency-update.py       # Dependency automation
└── code-quality-check.py      # Quality monitoring

automation/
├── __init__.py
├── github_integration.py      # GitHub API integration
├── quality_gates.py          # Automated quality checks
└── notification.py           # Slack/email notifications
```

**Key Components:**
- Repository health metrics collection
- Automated dependency updates
- Code quality monitoring
- Performance benchmarking automation
- Integration with external tools (GitHub, Slack)

### CHECKPOINT 8: Integration & Final Configuration

**Repository Settings to Configure:**
1. **Branch Protection Rules** (requires admin access):
   - Require PR reviews (minimum 1)
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Restrict pushes to main branch

2. **Repository Settings**:
   - Update description: "Toolkit for offline black-box optimization using learned gradient surrogates"
   - Set homepage: https://docs.terragon-labs.com/surrogate-optim
   - Add topics: `optimization`, `machine-learning`, `surrogate-models`, `jax`, `python`

3. **GitHub Apps and Integrations**:
   - Configure Dependabot for automated dependency updates
   - Set up CodeQL for security scanning
   - Configure branch protection automation

**Final Documentation Updates:**
```
README.md                      # Update with all implemented features
docs/GETTING_STARTED.md        # Comprehensive getting started guide
docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md        # Common issues and solutions
docs/DEPLOYMENT.md             # Production deployment guide
```

## Permission Requirements

To complete the remaining checkpoints, the following GitHub permissions are required:

- **Workflow Creation**: `actions:write` - To create GitHub Actions workflows
- **Repository Settings**: `admin` - To configure branch protection and repository settings
- **Security Scanning**: `security_events:write` - To configure security scanning
- **Dependency Management**: `contents:write` - For automated dependency updates

## Implementation Priority

1. **HIGH**: CHECKPOINT 6 (Workflow Documentation) - Critical for CI/CD
2. **MEDIUM**: CHECKPOINT 5 (Monitoring) - Important for production readiness
3. **MEDIUM**: CHECKPOINT 7 (Metrics & Automation) - Improves developer experience
4. **LOW**: CHECKPOINT 8 (Integration) - Final polish and configuration

## Estimated Implementation Time

- **CHECKPOINT 5**: 4-6 hours
- **CHECKPOINT 6**: 2-3 hours
- **CHECKPOINT 7**: 3-4 hours
- **CHECKPOINT 8**: 1-2 hours

**Total**: 10-15 hours for complete implementation

## Success Validation

After implementing the remaining checkpoints:

1. ✅ All GitHub Actions workflows pass
2. ✅ Branch protection rules are active
3. ✅ Security scanning is enabled
4. ✅ Monitoring dashboards display metrics
5. ✅ Automated dependency updates work
6. ✅ Health checks pass in production
7. ✅ Documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date

## Support

For questions about implementing the remaining checkpoints:
- Review existing implementations in completed checkpoints
- Consult the comprehensive documentation structure established
- Follow the patterns and conventions used in the codebase
- Test each checkpoint thoroughly before proceeding to the next
