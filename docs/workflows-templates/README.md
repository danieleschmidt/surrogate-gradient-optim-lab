# 🔧 GitHub Actions Workflow Templates

## Overview

This directory contains enterprise-grade GitHub Actions workflow templates designed for the surrogate-gradient-optim-lab repository. These workflows provide comprehensive CI/CD automation, security scanning, and release management.

## 📋 Workflow Templates

### 1. `ci.yml` - Comprehensive CI/CD Pipeline
**7-job enterprise workflow providing:**
- Code quality assurance with pre-commit hooks
- Multi-platform testing (Ubuntu, Windows, macOS)  
- Performance benchmarking with regression detection
- Multi-architecture container builds (AMD64, ARM64)
- Automated documentation deployment
- Security scanning integration
- Team notifications and PR comments

### 2. `security.yml` - Advanced Security Framework  
**Multi-layered security scanning including:**
- Static code analysis (CodeQL, Semgrep)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (Safety, pip-audit)
- Container security scanning (Trivy, Grype)
- Secret detection (GitLeaks, TruffleHog)
- License compliance checking
- SLSA provenance generation
- Compliance reporting and audit trails

### 3. `release.yml` - Full Release Automation
**Complete release lifecycle management:**
- Automated semantic versioning
- Multi-environment deployment (staging/production)
- Package publishing (PyPI + container registry)
- Changelog generation and documentation updates
- Health checks and rollback capabilities
- Environment promotion workflows

## 🚀 Quick Installation

**IMPORTANT**: Due to GitHub security restrictions, workflow files cannot be created automatically. Follow these steps:

```bash
# 1. Create workflows directory
mkdir -p .github/workflows/

# 2. Copy workflow templates
cp docs/workflows-templates/ci.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/workflows-templates/security.yml .github/workflows/
cp docs/workflows-templates/release.yml .github/workflows/

# 3. Commit and push
git add .github/workflows/
git commit -m "feat: add enterprise CI/CD workflows"
git push
```
